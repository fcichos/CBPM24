Assignments
============

We will supply also the problem sets (assignments) every week to all students. The assignments come as a Jupyter Notebook, with individual problems. Please fill in the code or answers your are asked for and return the notebooks **before the next weeks lecture (1pm!)** on Tuesdays directly on the server. You will receive the web address of our assignment server as well as a login and password. **Your password for your account is set at first login. Please be aware of that and remember the password.**


Assignment Rules
================

Here are some rules that are important for the assignments. 

- **The assignments are part of the exam and needs to be your own work. Copying from others and group work means violating the exam rules!** 
- You need to hand in 6 out of all exercise sheets with solutions handed in in time to pass this part of the exam.
- Solutions to the assignments will be discussed and presented in the exercises tuesday after the lecture.
