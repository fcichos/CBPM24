    "In particle simulations it is sometimes useful to detect collisions. This can be done for the sake of visualization or to really simulate physical collisions.\n",
    "Since we now know about classes. We will use this knowledge to imlement some basic collision detection to our particle system. The method we use for collision detection in this code is a simplified model and is not entirely physically correct. It's a basic form of collision detection and resolution that checks if two objects are overlapping and then pushes them apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more physically accurate model, you would also consider factors like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elasticity:** When two objects collide, they don't just stop or move away from each other. They bounce off each other with a certain amount of energy depending on their elasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Momentum Conservation:** In a real-world collision, the total momentum of the system (the sum of the momenta of the two colliding objects) is conserved before and after the collision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Angular Momentum:** If the collision is not head-on (i.e., the objects don't hit each other directly in the center), it can cause rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Friction:** This could also play a role in the collision, depending on the surfaces of the colliding objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the moment we would like to skip these physical complications and just implement a simple version. Later in the notebook you will get a more physically correct version."

    "\n",
    "The main ingredient for the solver is the solve_collision. This function looks for the overlap of two particles by calculating their distance. If the distance is smaller than the sum of their radii, then a collision occurs. To correct this collision, both particles involved in the colision are pushed back by the same amount `delta*(distance_vec/dist)`. While this is only done for a pair always, it might create trouble for other pairs. Yet we ignore all that. Also note that this is not according to the momentum conservation, as both particle are pushed along the connecting line by the same amount. "
