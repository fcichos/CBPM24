Exam
====

We will close this course with an exam in form of a final project. This final project shall be on a topic of your choice or on one of the topics we provide as example topics. Each individual student is required to hand in a Jupyter Notebook. No group work is allowed for the final project.

The final project is in the form of a **portfolio exam** as it consists of **two parts**. Each part has to be passed. If you fail in one part, the whole exam counts as failed!


**1. Successfull submission of exercise solutions**

We will hand out assignments weekly. You will have to hand in the solutions within a week with a strict deadline. 
Successful submission of 6 out of all exercise sheets in time means you have passed this part of the portfolio exam.

**2. Jupyter notebook containing the final project**

Notebooks shall follow the following outline

- **Introduction** You introduce into the problem you are covering with your notebook and motivate what your are going to do. The Introduction should also cover a basic theoretical description for the problem to be solved.
- **Results & Discussion** You develop the code for your problem and discuss and anotate the individual steps in your notebook. It is important that you discuss the individual results highlighting their consequences.
- **Summary** You summarize your findings.

Grading: Notebooks will be graded based on:

- structure of the notebook (outline, citations, ...)
- quality of the code (use of functions for repeated code, classes, modules, function of the notebook)
- quality of the plots (axis labels, readability of the labels)
- use of concepts we used for the notebooks (use of markdown, multiple code cells )

The deadline for handing in the project is **September 4, 2024, at 1pm sharp! Do not miss the deadline!!!!!!**

Please submit your projects via email to Andrea Kramer,  **firstname.surname@uni-leipzig.de**.


Since many of you asked for some guiding topics and I as well hope that you do not submit a simulation of planetary motion, here are some topics, though some of them might be for the advanced physicist.


Mechanics
*********
- planetary motion (of course)
- the Brachistochrone, first find out what it is, and then simulate it
- N-coupled pendula and mechanical waves
- elastic/inelastic collisions 
- spinning top


Thermodynamics/Statistical Physics
**********************************
- ideal gas law from microscopic particle motions and wall collisions
- Maxwell deamon, find out what it is and simulate
- entropy from microstates
- Carnot cycle
- Vicsek model, find out what it is and simulate


Optics
******
- Caustics: ray tracing through spherical surfaces with paraxial approximation
- Caustics: ray tracing through spherical surfaces without paraxial approximation
- imaging errors, aberations 
- ray tracing of a prism with wavelength dependent refractive index
- light propagation through and optical fiber


Electrodynamics
***************
- thin film interference
- electromagnetic wave propagation through thin films (Fresnel coefficients)
- double slit experiment with light 
- grating diffraction, grating resolution
- scattering of an electron on a Coulomb potential (classical)
- array of freely rotating magnets

Quantum Mechanics
*****************
- wave packet in a periodic potential
- scattering of an electron on a Coulomb potential (quantum mechanical)
